# jssp-fjssp-algorithm-selector
This repository stores code about the JSSP and FJSSP scheduling problem solved with two constraint programming solvers: IBM CPLEX CP Optimizer and Google's OR-Tools. Additionally, machine learning algorithms serve to make future predictions on the most suitable algorithm for an incoming instance. The datasets were created based on the performance of the CP solvers. 

The data input is aligned with benchmark test instances available in literature for the JSSP and FJSSP. The JSSP files are available at the JSSP instance collection: http://jobshop.jjvh.nl/
